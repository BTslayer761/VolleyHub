# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   npx expo start
   ```

3. Run on mobile device

   - **Install Expo Go** on your phone ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent))
   - Scan the QR code that appears in the terminal
   - Your app will load on your device!

   Or run on simulator/emulator:
   - **iOS**: `npm run ios` (Mac only)
   - **Android**: `npm run android` (requires Android Studio)

## Mobile App Setup

This is a **mobile-first** app built with Expo. See `MOBILE_SETUP.md` for detailed mobile setup instructions.

## Firebase Authentication

To enable login functionality, set up Firebase:
1. See `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` for step-by-step instructions
2. Create a `.env` file with your Firebase credentials
3. Enable Email/Password authentication in Firebase Console

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
